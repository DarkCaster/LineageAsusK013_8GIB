This package installs CPU microcode updates for the main Android boot configuration
when using me176c-boot.

The actual CPU microcode update is not included in this package.
Instead, it needs to be obtained separately and either
  - added to the root directory of the flashable ZIP package, or
  - placed in the same directory as the flashable ZIP package

You may need to rename the downloaded file to "microcode.bin" to make it visible
to this installer.

Intel does not release all of its CPU microcode update to the public.
Therefore it is quite hard to obtain the latest microcode update for the CPU
in this tablet.

However, fortunately there is an archive of the latest CPU microcode updates
maintained by the community: https://github.com/platomav/CPUMicrocodes

The latest microcode update for this tablet is the file that starts with
"cpu30678_plat02_".

At the time of this writing, the latest version is v837, available at:
